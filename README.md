# YT_to_Letterboxd-watchlist-updation

The core idea is, since YouTube is my source for trailers or movie reviews and stuff, whenever I add a film related video to a specific playlist, it should automatically be added to my Letterboxd watchlist.

YouTube has an API, Letterboxd doesn't.

### `YT PLaylist to Letterboxd watchlist Updation`
Add a film trailer to a specific playlist on YouTube:

Find it on your Letterboxd watchlist:

Steps to work with it:
1. Install dependencies
2. Add credentials to a newly created .env file
3. run `Letterboxd-YT.py`
4. you can also run a script using cronjob to automatically run this every day or so
